Hello! I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute for Mathematical and Computational Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC).

My research interests lie in numerical analysis and computational methods. I focus on finite element and boundary element methods, with applications to the numerical simulation of acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation.
